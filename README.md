In INFOTC-3530, I was introduced to UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems and interfeces. Including the file system, command shells,<br >
text editors, pipes and filters, input/output system, shell scripting and Regular Expressions. I incorporated aspects of programming<br>
in an UNIX environment, cloud computing, and containers. I was also introduced to System Administration and Operating Systems as a whole.<br >
I thought that this class was great because it provided me with a very different view on computers by literally going to the root of the device. Something I haven't done before!
